# Example Files

This directory contains example decoded copie_scr.sh files for reference.

## Files

- **`copie_scr_decoded_example.sh`** - Advanced decoded copie_scr.sh script with multiple features
  - Includes MMI3G/MMI3GP detection
  - Has version tracking comments from DrGER
  - More sophisticated than the simple launcher script

## Comparison with Main Script

- **Root `copie_scr_DECODED.sh`** - Simple launcher script (269 bytes)
- **This example** - Advanced script with additional features (311 bytes)

Both are valid copie_scr.sh implementations, but serve different purposes:

- **Simple version**: Basic launcher for MMI3G systems
- **Advanced version**: Enhanced with version detection and additional environment variables

## Usage

These are examples only. For actual RNS-850 use, stick with the files in the root directory which have been specifically configured for the RNS-850 platform.
