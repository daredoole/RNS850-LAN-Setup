# RNS-850 LAN Setup (Modified)

This repository contains a modified version of the LAN setup scripts, specifically tailored for the RNS-850 platform. 

## Purpose
- This version is **not compatible** with MMI3G or other hardware.
- All network, DHCP, and DNS settings are adjusted for RNS-850 requirements.

## Known Issues
- On my own RNS-850 unit, the process does not fully complete and no logs are written to the SD card. Troubleshooting is ongoing.

## Usage
- Ensure your device is an RNS-850 before using these scripts.
- All configuration files use Unix (LF) line endings for hardware compatibility.

## Support
If you encounter issues, please open an issue in this repository or contact daredoole.
